# Python Course

Welcome to my public Python learning repository! This repo documents my progress as I go through a structured Python course and build my skills by learning in public.

## ðŸš€ About This Repo

This is where I:

- Practice and complete Python exercises from my course(s)
- Build small projects to reinforce key concepts
- Share my learning notes, code snippets, and insights

Everything here is open-source to help others and to hold myself accountable.
